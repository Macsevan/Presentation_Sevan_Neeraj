# Presentation_Sevan_Neeraj
🎯 Objective: Predict the selling price of used cars based on various features using a Machine Learning model.  🧠 Model: Trained a Regression-based ML model (Linear Regression) to accurately estimate car prices.  📊 Dataset: Used a cleaned dataset (Cardetails.csv) containing real-world car attributes like brand, year, fuel type, etc.
# Car Price Prediction ML Project
